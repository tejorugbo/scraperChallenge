# scraperChallenge

1 INTRODUCTION This Test Plan, (though not a standard one), has been created in an attempt to describe the project which is simply the approaches and methodologies that will apply to the functional testing of the “https://www.ebay.com/b/Rolex-Wristwatches/31387/bn_2989578" page. It is limited in scope to the interview challenge. This document has clearly identified what the test deliverables will be, and what is deemed in and out of scope. The project is to, start on the ebay category page for Rolex watches (https://www.ebay.com/b/Rolex-Wristwatches/31387/bn_2989578), and to find the five watches with the most views in the last hour. The number of views can be found on the item page, located just below the title (see the image below).

2 SCOPE The document mainly targets the functional testing of the target page to retrieve the five watches with the most views in the last hour and validating data in report output as per Requirements Specifications provided by Client using Selenium WebDriver. 2.1 Functions to be tested. • Test will be written in Java using Selenium • Verification of the eBay Logo present on the landing page • Successful navigation to the search result pages of the returned search logging the URL • Search will stop when it cannot find any more watches to check, or when it has checked 250 watches.

2.2 Functions not to be tested.

No other than mentioned above in section 2.1 3 QUALITY OBJECTIVES 3.1 Primary Objectives A primary objective is to complete the set task with the following constraints: • Modern, well-structured code • Good documentation • Thoughtful error handling

4 TEST APPROACH The approach, that used, is Analytical therefore, in accordance to requirements-based strategy, where an analysis of the requirements specification forms the basis for planning, estimating and designing tests. 4.1 Test Automation The test will be automated using Selenium WebDriver with Java bindings 5 RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENT NEEDS

The tools used in the automation of this project are Eclipse, Selenium with Java bindings and Testng. Although no reporting tools were used in this project, extent reports can be integrated along with Log4j to log information.
